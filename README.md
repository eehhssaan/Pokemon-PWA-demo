# Demo for PWA using pokeapi.co

This project was bootstraped from create-react-app and contains pretty much the standard code for most part. The only thing to show/note is the additional functionally of PWA through serviceWorker.js file in the public folder

# Getting started
Since it coming from create-react-app, download this repo and run `npm start` to get this project up and running. For more information, simply refer to package.json file (we all know the drill)
